PyEchoIP Thanks
===============
This library is of my own creation. However in order to make it immediately useful
to its users, I have included in the code several 'default' providers that are well
known and publicly available on the internet.

I attempted to provide sources whose usage and licensing terms do not prohibit
inclusion or who do not provide such terms. I have attempted to contact sources
via contact instruction on each website or via whois lookup in order to offer
them a chance to ask for omission.

I have also attempted to create a library that will not abuse providers.

If you are a provider and would like to be removed from inclusion, please file
a github issue. I would also be happy to provide thanks/attribution by name.
