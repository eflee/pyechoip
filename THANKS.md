PyEchoIP Thanks
===============
This library is of my own creation. However in order to make it immediately useful
to its users, I have included in the code several 'default' providers that are well
known and publicly available on the internet.

These services come in various forms, some providing detailed GEOIP information and
some providing simple IPv4 information. I've attempted to provide sources whose usage
terms do not prohibit inclusion or who do not provide such terms. I have contacted
the maintainers of these APIs via contact instruction on each website or via whois
to ask for permission.

I have also attempted to create a library that will not abuse providers.

If you are a provider and would like to be removed from inclusion, please file
a github issue.
